Privileging is an internal process implemented within a healthcare facility for \\nthe purpose of verify ing and integrating the training and experience of the healthcare practitioner with \\nthe organization’s scope of service and to confirm that all granted privileges may be practiced within \\nthe amenities of the facility. Delineation of privileges must be an o ngoing process that should be \\nflexible enough to add new procedures or conditions to treat and be firm, fair, and consistent. \\nObtaining privileges is the right of all health care providers through an appropriate scheme.  \\n \\nPrivileging process must start wit h a list of competencies, associated with evidence, checked by the \\npractitioner, approved, or modified by the department head and finally discussed for approval by the \\ncredentialing and privileging committee of the facility or at times by a centralized cre dentialing and \\nprivileging committee approval. On other occasions, especially when advanced skills must be assessed, \\ncredentialing and privileging may be conducted in a referral hospital or center approved by the \\nauthority that rules the facility the pract itioner is looking to practice in. Some of the difficulties \\nencountered in the privilege delineation process involve granting privileges for new procedures, \\nmonitoring compliance with privileges, and granting privileges that may be performed by members of \\nseveral departments.  \\n \\nThe key to effective privilege delineation is that specific written criteria be applied uniformly to all \\nhealthcare providers. Once privileges are granted, they should be disseminated into the different areas \\nof the healthcare facility where the practition er will practice. Granted privileges are to be monitored \\nthrough performance evaluation, morbidity and mortality committees, infection rates, adverse events \\nrelated to the practitioner, etc. In some cases, privileges may be revisited, suspended, or entirel y \\nrevoked.  \\n \\nPrivileging is an internal or institutional issue, varies largely from sector to sector and from provider to \\nprovider. Different examples of privileging processes exit in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Some \\nhealthcare provider sectors use a cent ralized privileging practice covering its hospitals while others, \\nprivileging is left to the hospital itself. Another example is that most hospitals use some form of ‘laundry \\nlist’ for privileging, whereby the healthcare worker is offered a checklist of pr ivileges to choose from \\nthat can be initially verified by the Department Head followed by the Credentialing and Privileging \\nCommittee (CPC) within this hospital. 1  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 27}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 29 of 251 \\nAlternatively, other hospitals and health providers sectors may conduct competence -based pr ivileging. \\nIn this process, the training and experience per each privilege, especially for carrying out advanced or \\nhigh -risk medical procedures is thoroughly evaluated in terms of training quality, actual experience, \\nand mentoring. Continuous monitoring o f privileges also varies.  \\n  \\nCredentialing practices vary despite a centralized body, namely the SCFHS. In KSA, issues in \\ncredentialing directly lead to flaws in the privileging process. Healthcare facilities are required to \\nensure that all practitioners a re credentialed and carry valid licenses. The credentialing of healthcare \\npractitioners in KSA is centralized in the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) involving two \\nmain courses for credentialing namely, credentialing of Saudi healthcare prac titioners with local \\nqualifications and credentialing of expatriates and Saudi healthcare practitioners with overseas \\nqualifications.  \\n \\nThere is a major process gap and cause for concern with applicants arriving to KSA and practicing in \\nadvance of completin g the entire Primary Source Verification (PSV) process.

In 2014, within the Kingdom, \\nevery 1000 population was served by 11 healthcare professionals; this is half the average rate of 22 \\nhealthcare professionals per 1000 population in G20 countries (Al -Hanawi, Khan & Al -Borie, 2019). \\nThe establ ishment of minimum safe staffing requirements has the potential to stabilize the health \\nworkforce to meet society’s evolving healthcare demands and support the provision of safe patient \\ncare.  \\nThe assurance of minimum safe staffing requirements is a major strategic intervention to improve the \\nsafety of patients and the well -being of health workers.  It is the only mechanism to safeguard \\nadequate staffing levels, in all settings, at all times.  \\nCurrently, there is a vast variation in staffing levels at healt hcare facilities throughout the Kingdom. \\nSuch variation in staffing levels negatively impacts the provision of care, resulting in missed care, \\nmedical errors, and adverse events leading to avoidable patient harm, including patient death. \\nVariation in staff ing levels also negatively impacts health workers at large, with increased levels of \\nwork -related injuries, job dissatisfaction, burnout, and turnover.  Minimum safe staffing \\nrequirements that ensure adequate staffing across the private and public sectors is a required first \\nstep to guarantee both staff and patient safety.   \\nSafe staffing is achieved when an appropriate number of health workers are always available across \\nthe continuum of care with the correct education, skills/competence, and experience to  deliver safe \\npatient care. The evidence is definitive. Healthcare facilities with adequate staffing standards have \\nlower costs through decreased length of stay, prevention of hospital -acquired infections, reduced \\npressure injuries, fewer medication errors , lower staff turnover, and increased patient and staff \\nsatisfaction. Therefore, safe staffing standards are the most cost -effective approach to bringing about \\nimprovements in patient safety and the quality of care.  \\nCountries with understaffed healthcare s ystems endanger their own citizens' health, becoming \\nthereby more vulnerable to crises and their corresponding negative economic and social impact (UN \\nHigh -Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, 2016).  \", metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 37}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 39 of 251 \\nSafe staffing levels ensures that  the Saudi healthcare system achieves universal health coverage as \\nwell as the Kingdom’s population health goals for Vision 2030 and national security goals.

Patients with varying \\ninjuries and illnesses go to the EDs expecting the best care in the fastest time. With limited emergency \\nresources (mainly manpower),  EDs are responsible to direct the right attention to the right patients at \\nthe right time. But with the significant increase of patients visiting EDs yearly, serving everyone \\npromptly becomes a challenging mission. Patients present to EDs without prior ap pointment, either on \\ntheir own or by an ambulance. Due to the unplanned nature of patients visits, the ED provides initial \\ntreatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life -threatening and \\nrequire immediate intervention. E Ds often become important entry points for those without other \\nmeans of access to medical care (Safety Net).  \\nEDs offer access 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. ED staff include paramedics, nurses, technicians, \\nreception and administrative staff, porters, se curity guards, and emergency medicine physicians. The \\nmedical staff are highly trained in all aspects of emergency medicine.  \\nObjectives:  \\nEvery patient visiting the ED is entitled to:  \\n• Access to emergency care  \\n• Quality emergency services  \\n• Safety  \\nTopic s: \\n• Clinical (patient care pathway)  \\n• Administration (management)  \\n• Professional  \\n• Education and Training   \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 70}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 72 of 251 \\n \\nED.1 .

A good rule is  to have one bathroom \\nfor every 6 patient beds and one bathroom for every 10 staff members.  \\nThe ED is a safe environment for delivering patient care. One important element of safe care is to control \\naccess to the area through automatic closing doors.  \\nThe E D provides a private space for staff to rest, socialize and eat.

A camera that looks directly at the waiting room can be used to \\nsee outside the department.  \\nEMS patients need to have a separate point of entry from the regular ED entrance to ensure safe and \\nquick unloading of patients who have receiv ed initial medical care.  \\nMoving critically sick patients out of the emergency department is easy and effective to ensure quick \\nservice provision of needed services.  \\n \\nED.3 The hospital ensures the required resources are available for accessible emergency care.  \\nED.3.1.

In hospitals with capacity to perform thrombolysis, all eligible patients with disabling \\nischemic stroke, who are within 4.5 hours from the onset of stroke symptoms, under door -to-\\nneedle intravenous thrombolysis within 60 minutes.  \\nExplanations:  \\nIn the last two decades acute stroke care has been transformed due to results from multiple trials that \\ndemonstrated that ischemic stroke can be effectively treated with reperfusion therapy (intravenous and \\nintra -arterial). The phrase \"Time is brain\", indicates the earlier the treatment is started the better. The \\nwindow for intervention is very short, thus it is essential to have a pre -defined pathway and protocol to \\nfacilitate prompt recognition of stroke and expedite management or transfer.  \\nStroke is a medical emergency requiring rapid recognition and management. Many strok es will lead to \\ndeath or disability if not treated promptly. Standardized medical care results in better outcomes and less \\nvariability in healthcare provision. Each patient with acute stroke should be viewed as a medical \\nemergency and a potential candidate  for reperfusion therapy, and should have rapid assessment to \\ndetermine eligibility. Tele -stroke services can be utilized to increase access to acute stroke care for \\nhospitals with limited in -house expertise or prolonged transfer time.  \\n** The FAST score is  a rapid screening test used for acute stroke, and stands for Face, Arm, Speech and \\nTime (the Arabic version عاجل  is occasionally used for stroke education).

All hospitals capable of administrating thrombolysis have an evidence -based protocol \\noutlining indications, contraindi cations, post thrombolysis care and complication management.  \\nExplanations:  \\nIntravenous thrombolytic therapy is the primary pharmacological therapy for acute ischemic stroke and is \\nproven to significantly improve functional outcome.  Intravenous thrombolyt ic therapy increases patient \\nsurvival rates up to fifty percent.  However, there is also a 3 -6% increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage \\nwith intravenous thrombolytic therapy.

(1) PTS is the most common chronic \\ncomplication of VTE, which causes chronic limb pain, swelling, and leg ulcers.  Internationally, the \\ntrue incidence of VTE is approximately 25,000 cases per year, with a fatality rate of 6 -10 percent.  \\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is of  two types, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary \\nembolism (PE), and is a relatively common disease affecting approximately 100 per 100,000 people \\nper year. (1, 3) Hence, it is estimated that around 25,000 people are involved in Saudi Arabia (KSA) \\nannu ally. \\n \\nThe main risk factors for the development of VTE are age, surgery, antenatal, cancer, immobility \\ntrauma, puerperium, hormonal use, obesity, and inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states. (3) \\nVTE is considered a significant risk for many types of  patients, i.e., the elderly, surgical patients, \\nantenatal patients, and patients in intensive care units.(4) For example, the incidence of hospital \\nacquired VTE is 10 -40% among surgical patients.(5)  In one study conducted locally at a tertiary -care \\nhospi tal in Saudi Arabia, investigators identified 500 confirmed cases of VTE in one year with a fatality \\nrate of 20.8%; with two -thirds of those patients being in surgical wards and one third in the medical \\nwards.(5)  The study also indicated that only 44.1% o f surgical patients and 21.7% received \\nappropriate thromboprophylaxis. (5)  \\nHowever, another study, conducted at seven major hospitals in Saudi Arabia, found 1241 confirmed \\nVTE cases over a 12 months period (6). Most (58.3%) of the VTE cases were DVT only,  21.7% were PE, \\nand 20% were DVT and PE (6). In this study, the majority of the confirmed VTE cases occurred in \\nmedical patients (78.6%), but only 40.9% of the cases received appropriate thromboprophylaxis \\n(63.2% for surgical patients and 34.8% for medical  patients; P < 0.001).

The outcome of the surgery is not only about the surgical \\nprocedure, but a series of events leading up to, during and after the surgery (1).  \\nThe incident of adverse events varied from 3% to 17% during hospitalization (2,3). Although Most of \\nthe ad verse events were resulted in minor or temporary disability, but a proportion of the adverse \\nevents, 4% to 21%, contributed to death (4). All these studies have shown that a high percentage of \\nadverse events are attributable to surgical specialties, rangin g from 51% to 77% (5), with range of 50 \\n% of the adverse events are ruled to be preventable (4). In famous surgical events systematic review, \\nthat included 16,424 surgical patients, Anderson et al (6) concluded the following:  \\nAdverse events occurred in 14. 4% of patients and potentially preventable adverse events occurred in \\n5.2%. The consequences of 3.6% of adverse events were fatal, those of 10.4% were severe, those of \\n34.2 were moderate, and those of 52.5% were minor. Errors in nonoperative management cau sed \\nmore frequent adverse events than errors in surgical technique.  \\nThe operating room is unique area in which multi background specialties health care workers \\navailable with rapid pace actions, different reporting structure and advance technology and \\nequi pment.

However, \\nsome patients will deteriorate even with appropriate and timely care. This deterioration is commonly \\ndue to complications of the primary illness, progression of an  acute illness, or the complications of \\ncorrect treatment despite best practice preventive measures.  \\nAcute deterioration is often time -critical, arising over minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. \\nThese may lead to medical emergencies. including unpl anned admission to the intensive care unit \\n(ICU), in -hospital cardiac arrest and death [1 –4].  When occur, the risk of death is greater than 80 \\npercent after in -hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest as indicated in several \\nstudies  [5, 6].  \\nLife threatening emergencies and events do not happen without warning. Several studies indicate that \\nalmost all critical inpatient events are preceded by warning signs for an average of 6 –8 hours. [2,7,8]. \\nIn multicenter , prospective cohorts, clin ical antecedents, such as a change in vital signs, are present in \\nthe majority of patients (60 to 70 percent) before in -hospital cardiac arrest occurs [3, 7] and such \\nsevere changes in vital signs were found to be associated with a 6.8 -fold increase in mor tality (95% CI \\n2.7-17.1) [9]. Simultaneously, studies in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK[1 -12] estimate that \\nadverse events occur in 10% of hospitalized patients with a mortality rate of 5 –8%,[8,9].  \\nUnfortunately, as many as 50 -70% of these adverse events are judged to be preventable. [8, 13] Of the \\navoidable cases, 35 percent had a delay in nursing staff communicating with the physician, and 29 \\npercent had a delay in the physician responding to the nurse’s request [13].  \\nAnother important factor aff ecting patient outcome in hospitals is Delay in ICU transfer for the critically \\nill in the wards, which is not uncommon [14] and leads to higher mortality when patient transfer to \\nhigher levels of care is delayed [15, 16]. In addition, some critically ill patients are either inappropriately \\nadmitted to the general ward, rather than to the ICU, from the emergency department or \\ndecompensate rapidly shortly after admission. Therefore, these patients’ outcome would improve if \\nthey were identified and transferre d earlier to the required higher level of care to facilitate timely \\ninterventions and treatment.  \\nFor those hospitalized patients experiencing clinical deterioration outside the intensive care unit (ICU), \\na mismatch between an acute increase in a patient’s needs and available resources occur [17]. \\nRecognizing these patients early, represent a window of opportunity in which to rescue deteriorating \\npatients before irreversible morbidity or mortality occurs. This concept of “rescue” for the hospitalized \\npatient  has led to the development of rapid response systems (RRS) designed to identify and respond \\nto deteriorating patients by moving critical personnel, diagnostics, and interventions to the bedside.

Subsequently, the Joint Commission \\nmandated that United States hospitals should establish RRSs as part of the 2008 National Patient Safety \\nGoals [19] Most recently, the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary \\nResuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care continue to recommend RRSs, especially in \\ngeneral care wards  [20]. \\nRapid response systems (RRS) are put in  place to improve the safety of hospitalized patients whose \\ncondition is deteriorating quickly by identifying them by timely notification upon early signs of \\ndeterioration, bring the expertise (team of responders) capable of providing critical care resourc es and \\ninterventions at the patient’s current location to the patients in timely manner, rapid intervention by \\nthe response team, and ongoing evaluation of the system’s performance and hospital -wide processes \\nof care leading to Preventing deterioration lea ding to life threatening events, prompt therapy and \\nresuscitation as needed and transfer to higher level of care while promoting education and higher \\npatient safety culture.  \\nGenerally, RRS are multidisciplinary and comprised of four limbs: 1) an afferent limb, which is the calling \\ncriteria and the method of activation, 2) an efferent limb, which is the Rapid Response Team (RRT) \\nitself, 3) an administrative limb, which is responsible for the day -to-day running of the RRS and 4) the \\nquality improvement and g overnance limb which addresses system and clinical factors contributing to \\ndeterioration [17].  \\nIn the majority of the studies, the introduction of a RRS resulted in an overall reduced rate of \\nunexpected cardiac arrest outside ICU, unscheduled critical care  admissions and hospital mortality [21 -\\n25] such as 46% reduction in cardiac arrest rates; a 54% reduction in cardiac arrest related mortality \\nrates; a 19% reduction in hospital mortality; a 35% decrease in failure to rescue rates [26]. Similarly, \\ndelay in activation of the RRS for decompensating patients is independently associated with increased \\nmortality [27].  \\nImplementation of an RRS was associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality (relative risk \\n[RR]= 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]:  0.83 -0.93, I(2) = 86%, 3,478,952 admissions) and a significant \\ndecrease in the number of non -ICU cardiac arrests (RR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55 -0.69, I(2) = 71%, 3,045,273 \\nadmissions) [25,28].  \\nIn Saudi Arabia, there is published literature regarding the impact of RRS application. The hospital \\nmortality rate dropped from 7.8 to 2.8 per 1000 hospital admission and Hospital cardiopulmonary \\narrest rate has dropped from 10.53 per 1000 hospital admissions to 2.58[28]. In another local study \\ninvolving more than 1000 ra pid response activation over a year of study perio d, there was low mortality \\nrates in those RRS were activated for and have identified the risk factors higher age (>70 years).

The wide variability of healthcare services \\nand population across the Kingdom has made patient transfer an essential part of achieving these \\nobjectives.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has numerous healthcare facilities which include but \\nare not limited to hospitals, medica l cities, and specialized centers. As highly specialized care is \\ncurrently available mainly in the big cities, the accessibility for such services is very challenging in \\nperipheries without appropriate patient transfer guidelines. Based on Ministry of Heal th (MOH) data, \\nthere were around 354,275 transfer requests through the Saudi National Referral System (EHALA) in \\n2020. Therefore, the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) identified \\npatient transfer as a national health priority.  \\nPatient transfer is a frequently performed task during care of hospitalized patients. Patient \\ntransfer is an essential part of patient care that is usually undertaken to improve patient management. \\nTransfers may be due to various reasons such as patients requiring specialized care not available in the \\nreferring location or a need for advanced diagnostic skills or equipment. Specialized care that requires \\ntransfer could include, for instance, pediatrics neuroscience, spinal injury burns, or a varie ty of other \\nspecialties.  \\nFurthermore, patients are often transferred within the same hospital. This may involve \\ntransferring patients between hospital units for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, or even for \\nconsultation. Patients may come from the Emer gency Department (ED), Operating Rooms (OR), Critical \\nCare Units (CCU), wards, or any other hospital areas. During all types of transfers, the main aim is to \\nmaintain the continuity of medical care. Patient transfer is particularly challenging when patient s are \\nmoved to a new environment with different care settings and staff. In addition, the transfer of an ill \\npatient can induce various alterations of the clinical status, such as deterioration of physiological \\nparameters including hemodynamic instabilitie s or other vital parameters, or displacement or \\nmalfunctioning of tubes, lines or equipment which can also adversely affect the status of the patient. \\nTherefore, the transfer process should be reviewed thoroughly, and it should be initiated ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 146}), Document(page_content=\" \\nPage 148 of 251 \\nsystematically and according to the evidence -based guidelines. The critical elements of safe transfer \\ninvolve appropriate decision to transfer and proper communication, pretransfer preparation, \\nstabilization, suitable escorts and personnel accompanying the patient, choos ing the proper mode of \\ntransport, monitoring equipment during the transfer, accurate and comprehensive documentation and \\ncorrect hand -over at the receiving hospital or other facility.  \\nIncorrect transfer mechanisms and dynamics can put the patient in a pote ntially dangerous \\nenvironment and has the potential for multiple miscommunication risks. Moreover, the transferring \\nteam is mainly operating independently. Hospitals that conduct patients' transfers should ensure \\nproper protocols, personnel, equipment, tra ining, and support to ensure the patient's optimal health \\nand wellbeing during the transfer process. It is essential that a standardized and complete approach is \\ntaken to patient transfer; beginning with the transfer decision until handover of the patient to the \\nreceiving unit.  \\nMultiple guidelines have been proposed to perform the patient transfer safely. The various \\nprofessional bodies have formulated guidelines for safe patient transfer, including the Ministry of \\nHealth (MOH), American College of Critical  Care Medicine, American Society of Critical Care Medicine, \\nAssociation of Anesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, American Society of Anesthesiologist. The \\nguidelines emphasized different key elements; however, all the guidelines maintain the principal  goal \\nof a safe transfer.  \\nWritten transfer protocols and interfacility agreements should be in place, especially when \\npatients' transfer is part of a regional plan to provide optimal care at a specialized medical facility.  \\nPatient transport is an essential  part of a patient -centered approach of care and positive patient \\nexperience. The transfer decision should be undertaken when the benefits of transfer outweigh the \\nrisks. The choice of receiving hospitals should be based primarily on specialized care avail ability and \\nproximity to the referring hospital. The aim is to seek transfer to a nearby hospital that provides a high \\nlevel of quality care. The level of care provided during patient transport should be based on the \\npatient's clinical status, national sta ndards and regulations and any anticipated problems. The \\ntransport team should have policies and procedures to direct their practice.

The transport team should be capable of evaluating the patient's \\nresponse during the transport. It is known that education and proper preparation are key to any safe \\ntransfer.  \\nThe Operating Room (OR) is a critical area in all he althcare facilities with high financial value \\nand significant impact. OR transfers require a specific patient's handling process for perioperative \\npatient transfer to maintain efficient flow and proper bed utilization. Furthermore, the OR handles all \\npatie nt categories, from different locations, regardless of their current medical condition. Transfers to \\nthe OR may come from a variety of locations including Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Pediatric Intensive \\nCare Unit (PICU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU),  Emergency Department (ED) or other specialty \\nareas, thus this variety necessitates a standardized protocol for bidirectional communication and \\ntransfer processes.  \\nIn addition, the transfer process in OR should maintain a procedure to reduce human factors \\naffecting the transfer and patient safety. The goal is to maintain proper situational awareness, proper \\ncommunication channels, and closed -loop communication between healthcare providers.  \\nTransporting a critically ill patient is usually associated with sig nificant complications. For any \\nhospital to reduce the patient's risks, such transports should be appropriately organized, accompanied \\nby the proper personnel and equipment and efficiently done. Guidelines and Protocols for transferring \\ncritically ill pati ents should be fully used across all healthcare facilities. In addition, care provided during \\ntransportation and at the site of the procedure or diagnostic testing should be equivalent to the care \\ndelivered in the originating unit.  \\nIt is known that timely transfer of patients from the ICUs to the wards is one aspect of proper \\nhand -over, which positively affects overall patient care. Although optimal patient flow is critical to \\nensure quality patient care, there is no clear evidence regarding the best way to  achieve a safe and \\nefficient patient transfer from the ICUs, particularly in the pediatric population.  \\nAnother consideration to keep in mind is critically ill neonates. Neonates may have absent or \\nsmall physiological reserves, which makes them very suscep tible to a life -threatening situation. Such \", metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 148}), Document(page_content=\" \\nPage 150 of 251 \\nthreats may result in adverse physiological changes in these patients during intra - or inter -hospital \\ntransport. Ventilator‐dependent and hemodynamically unstable patients are at notably higher risk.  \\nCareful plan ning is always required to move these critically ill patients between the different \\nhospital units such as ICUs, operating theatres, medical imaging rooms, emergency departments, and \\ngeneral wards. Although, most intra -hospital transfers (defined as transf erring patients between \\nhospital units) are elective, the need for urgency should always be anticipated such as moving the \\npatient to the operating theatres after a diagnostic procedure.  \\nInterfacility transport is defined as the transport of patients betwe en two healthcare \\norganizations. The process is generally accomplished through ground transportation. Interfacility \\ntransfers, either for a stable (not urgent) or a critical (urgent) patient, is a crucial part of today's \\nhealthcare system that allows hospi tals to transfer patients needing specialized care which cannot be \\nadequately performed in their current facility.  \\n        This document and standards aim to provide standardized transfer procedures that will ensure \\nthe safest inter and intra facility transfers for all patients while maintaining a continuum of care. It aims \\nto minimize risks and maximize patient safety during transfers based on the current evidence -based \\npractice and agreed upon recommendations in this regard.  \\n \\n  \", metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 149}), Document(page_content=\" \\nPage 151 of 251 \\n \\nPT.1.

The ability of any \\nmedical system to provide measures and therapies to improve outcomes depends on the presences \\nof good critical car e service. Critical or intensive care provided in specific units are called critical or \\nintensive care units (ICUs). Critical illness has been crudely estimated to result in several million \\ndeaths globally each year. The outcomes of them depends on the sta ndards of care of units hosting \\npatients. The importance of ICU becomes clear with the advance of medical and surgical therapies for \\ndifferent illness. During disaster and pandemics, the pressure on ICU and the need for organ and lives \\nsaving measures paly  a measure and pivotal role in the success to manage such situation and reduce \\nmortalities.  \\n \\nEstablishing an ICU in every institution must match the services, patients’ population, and complexity \\nof care. A minimum standard in every ICU is essential to provide safe and efficient care. In addition, \\nrecognizing the vital role of ICU make a focus on the ICU in the health system as a national health \\npriority to set a required standard to ensure ability of any health care facility to provide the expected \\nrole and services, to contribute to the accommodation and management of any unforeseen situation \\nfacing the whole system, and setting a standard that matches the level of care provided in each ICU \\nand guide the institution to provide best quality care.  \\n \\nIt is essential to develop these standards for critical care services in relation to healthcare providers, \\nhospital space, tools utilized and processes of coordination among all these aspects.  \\n \\nAs the nature and delivery of intensive care services are evolving with great speed. With both \\nincreased in complexity of treatments being delivered and, in the types / levels of facilities to \\naccommodate changes in service delivery. Patients in critical care units require complicated care \\nplans, rapid decision making, cl ose monitoring, and constant support from highly trained workforces \\nspecialize in caring for the sickest of patients.  \\n \\nThe annual cost is a challenging aspect of medical care, particularly in critical care units. It was \\nestimated to represent an average of  13% of the actual health care costs worldwide. While a lot of \\nthese expenses are attributed to waste, some of them were related to lack of knowledge of what are \\nthe minimum requirements to run a safe practice. Hence, a lot of resources are consumed to cov er \\nup pitfalls and retrospective catch up.  \\n \\nIn fact, evidence confirms that the likelihood of serious complications and mortality rates increases \\nwhen fewer workforces especially registered nurses assigned to patient care. Similarly, a considerable \\namount of research indicates healthy work environments and better patient outcomes when a higher \\npercentage of patient care delivery provided by registered nurses.

End ‐of‐life is defined as a phase of life when a person is living with an illness that will \\nworsen and eventually cause death. It is not necessari ly limited to a short period of time when the \\nperson is moribund. EOLC as a part of palliative care is person and family ‐centered care provided for a \\nperson with an active, progressive, advanced disease, who has little or no prospect of cure and who is \\nexpected to die: and for whom the primary treatment goal is to optimize the quality of life.  \\n\"Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the \\nproblems associated with life ‐threatening illness, throug h the prevention and relief of suffering \\nthrough early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, \\nphysical, psychosocial and spiritual.\" (WHO DEFINITION). Worldwide, there is a major population of \\nadults in need of p alliative care who have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (38.5%), \\ncancer (34%), chronic respiratory diseases (10.3%), AIDS (5.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). Many other \\nconditions may require palliative care, including kidney failure, chronic live r disease, multiple \\nsclerosis, Parkinson ’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, congenital \\nanomalies, and drug ‐resistant tuberculosis. Today, Saudi Arabia (SA) has a total population of over \\n32.3 million, and the majority are Saud is based on 2016 statistics. The percentage of the population \\nliving in urban areas is 82.3% and the life expectancy at birth is 76 years. The burden of disease (2016) \\nattributable to communicable diseases is 11%, non ‐communicable diseases 73.0% and injuri es 16%. \\nThe total deaths are over 114,000 and non ‐communicable diseases are accounted for 73% of these \\ndeaths. This population can benefit tremendously if they were managed by palliative care services \\nwhen access is guaranteed for them before death. Distre ssing symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, pain, \\nfatigue, and anxiety) will be controlled, and individuals will be able to die with dignity, with their \\nwishes respected; and families are also more likely to report satisfaction with care. Numerous, well ‐\\ndefined symptoms are associated with end ‐of‐life, if unrelieved, are distressing to both the patients \\nand their families and preclude any possibility of relieving biopsychosocial suffering, improving quality \\nof life, or completing life closure. This requires a mul tidisciplinary, total ‐person approach to achieve \\nrelief from symptoms complexity.

The societal and economic \\narguments for deliv ering effective EOLC are powerful. Unplanned emergency hospital admissions are \\ncommon because the end ‐of‐life period is not well managed. If such admissions could be reduced \\nthrough improved EOLC, inpatient care would be reserved for the acutely ill, reduc ing the burden on \\nthe health service. Symptom assessment in children may be more complex than in adults because of \\nvariable developmental stages and communication abilities and reliance on parental symptom \\nevaluation. Many of the 20,000 US children (age 1 to 19 years) who die annually from serious illness \\nand their caregivers do not receive high ‐quality EOLC. A study of children with advanced cancer \\nrevealed that 48% had pain, 46% fatigue, and 37% irritability. The circumstances and details of \\npediatric dea th can be different from those for the death of an adult, partly because of higher \\nhospital death rates in pediatrics. Less than 7% of hospital deaths occur in patients younger than age \\n45 years, and most children with chronic conditions die in the hospita l. Measures to evaluate in ‐\\nhospital EOLC are also needed and may include access to nursing for dying children, private rooms for \\npatients, and relaxed visitor policies to allow for visits by young siblings and visits after hours. \\nBereaved parents represent  another vulnerable group with high rates of psychological distress. \\nPsychological distress and caregiving burden also have financial implications; 24% of bereaved \\nfamilies of children with cancer face significant economic hardship because of their child ’s illness. \\nEnd‐of‐life care should be multidimensional, culturally relevant, respecting of religious sensitivities, \\nand focused on respecting patient ’s wishes. Families of patients have the right to grieve and be \\nsupported in the bereavement phase. Pain ass essment and management, including safe opioid \\nprescribing, is identified as an organizational priority. The pain experience is unique, complex, \\nchallenging for professionals, and has biopsychosocial implications, which require best management \\ndelivered by a multidisciplinary team. \"Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional \\nexperience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage or \\nboth ” (International Association for the Study of Pain, 1994).  \\nThe wide r ange of clinical disorders with progressive illness leading to death demands that improved \\ncare for patients at end ‐of‐life becomes the focus of all medical specialists who will encounter dying \\npatients during their practice.

Antidotes and reversal agents for opioids, benzo diazepines, and, insulin, are \\navailable and readily accessible in all areas where these high -alert medication(s) are available, \\nstored, and might be administered.  \\nExplanation:  \\nHigh-Alert Medications are those medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient \\nharm when they are used in error. Although mistakes may or may not be more common with these drugs, \\nthe consequences of an error are clearly more devasta ting to patients. Defining a list of high -alert \\nmedications available in the hospital is the first step in guiding customized, robust, and sustainable risk -\\nreduction strategies to eliminate harm associated with their use.  \\nThe designed risk -reduction strate gies should aim to prevent errors, make errors visible, and/or mitigate \\nharm if an error happened. Each identified high -alert medication/class should be studied for potential \\nrisks and the underlining cause of errors to properly layer the system -focused in terventions.  \\nNewly hired healthcare providers who are involved in total parenteral nutrition and chemotherapy \\nmedications prescribing, preparing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring undergo baseline \\ncompetency assessment to ensure their familiarity with the system and assess their knowledge, and an \\nannual training thereafter  to share information on internal and external reported risks or error, and \\ndeveloped risk -reduction strategies.  \\nThis standard aim is to fo cus on selected high -alert medications/classes and risk -reduction strategies to \\neliminate errors associated with their use that continue to be reported despite several published \\nwarnings and recommendations.  \\nReported fatalities resulting from direct administration of concentrated electrolytes (e.g., potassium \\nchloride, potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate) have encouraged several \\norganizations to endorse eliminating the storage of their concentrated forms from all patient care units \\nand recommend that they are to be prepared and supplied from the pharmacy. If this is not possible, \\nother strategies t o ensure their safe use need to be considered.  \\nVinca alkaloid can lead to fatal neurological damage if a dministered intrathecally. Dispensing them in \\nminibags of compatible solution can eliminate the risk of inadvertent intrathecal administration.  \\nSeveral instances of death resulting from inadvertent administration of daily dosing of methotrexate have \\nbeen reported.

Sixty percent of medication errors occur during the ordering or \\nprescribing stage. Typical errors include the healthcare provider writin g the wrong medication, wrong \\nroute or dose, or the incorrect frequency.  \\nTherefore, hospitals are required to use a safe and reliable mechanism for ordering medications such as a \\ncomputerized prescriber order entry system (CPOE). The CPOE has emerged as a  valuable tool to improve \\nmedical efficiency and to decrease medication errors and ADEs. It has proven to be a secure way of \\ntransferring physician orders electronically thus enabling hospitals and physicians to practice a more \\neffective and better quality  of care.  \\nSafe medication ordering and the medication order review process should be guided by hospital policies \\nand procedures. The policy must be developed and monitored by medical, nursing, pharmacy, and \\nadministrative staff to ensure appropriate medica tion order review before medications dispensing.  \\nThe process to conduct an appropriateness review for an order or prescription prior to dispensing \\nincludes evaluation of the following items: medication regimen, indication, therapeutic duplication, \\ndrug/foo d interactions, contraindication, related laboratory values, allergy, and pregnancy status.

Hospital \\naccreditation schemes are mechanisms that can assist hospital management to improve health care \\nservices through the development of standards for safety, guidance and monitor ing for continued \\nsupport in clinical operations, technical development, communication skills and emergency \\npreparedness aspects. The ultimate goal of hospital management is to respond equally to the \\nexpectations of patients for efficient health services a nd good quality care. Hospital accreditation \\nprovides a systematic system of promoting good health by putting into place the means to measure \\nquality care and good management.  \\nFor the day -to-day activities in a medical institution, safety encompasses a wid e realm of people, \\nplaces, environment and facilities that require different approaches and degrees of safety. Practices, \\nrisk assessment and internal and external evaluation of safety for people, places, environment and \\nfacilities become part of the plann ing before and during hospital operations. Comprehensive and \\nstrategic assessment of tools, equipment and staff performance are all important aspects in the quality \\nevaluation to ensure safety.  \\nOne facet of safety is the use of ionizing radiation in medici ne. Ionizing radiation -based technologies \\nare used as an essential tool for diagnosis and treatment purposes. Their benefit is immense and serves \\nmost departments within any healthcare facility.  However, like many areas of medicine, the benefit is \\nassocia ted with a risk that must be kept as low as reasonably achievable. Conversely, the utilization of \\nhigh dose imaging equipment like computed tomography (CT) has tripled in the last decade and studies \\nhave demonstrated that a significant percentage of these investigations show no useful information. \\nIn countries like the US, Europe and Canada, these are highly governed practices that still need \\nimprovement, optimization, and standardization. Currently, there is a worldwide concern on patient \\nsafety due to ove rutilization and misuse.  \\nEarly reports on the biological effects of ionizing radiation among watch dial painters, industrial \\nworkers, users in hospitals, victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and nuclear power plant \\naccidents confirm the harmful effe cts of radiation. In addition, injuries, and deaths in radiotherapy \\naccidents demonstrated the need for protection of people and the environment.  As a result, standards \\nfor the safe use of radiation and radioactive sources were developed and undergo conti nued review \\nand revision.  These standards were developed based on epidemiological studies, reports of the United \\nNation Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and recommendations of \\nthe International Commission on Radiological P rotection (ICRP). They are basis of the International \\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its safety standards for protection. The IAEA first initiated the \\ndevelopment of safety standards in 1958 and continue to develop updated standards for the many \\ndifferent applications of radiation to assess and control the risk of harmful effects from radiation.  \\nThe publication of the ICRP in 1990 included the stochastic effects (cancer induction and hereditary) \\nand deterministic effects of radiation such as skin injuries, the short and long -term biological effects ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 217}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 219 of 251 \\nand the risks associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The contributing features of \\nradiological protection for patients and members of the public, namely justification, optimization and \\ndose limitation s, are being defined in the publication. Recommendations on the annual dose limits for \\noccupationally exposed individuals and members of the public were issued by ICRP based on \\nepidemiological studies and reports of accidents and these values were updated in the latest ICRP \\nPublication 103 issued in 2005. Recommended dose limits to the fetus and recommendations for \\npregnant radiation workers and patients including patients who are breast -feeding are also contained \\nin the ICRP publications. The new and curre nt ICRP publication has updated the recommended \\nradiation weighting factors based on new scientific studies and has included the protection of the \\nenvironment.  This publication has identified distinctions between two major health effects, namely \\nskin inju ries for deterministic effects and stochastic effects. The publication also highlighted radiation \\nprotection in emergency and unintended exposure situations.  \\nThe IAEA Basic Safety Standards and other safety standards are in harmony with the ICRP \\nrecommenda tions. It has also issued publications regarding the safety of radiation sources, \\nmanagement of hospital radioactive wastes and diagnostic reference levels. A specific publication on \\nthe safety of occupationally exposed individuals has been issued by IAEA.  The IAEA standards of \\nprotection publication emphasizes the role of the government on regulating and setting up radiation \\nprotection infrastructure. It is then the responsibility of the national regulatory agencies of each \\ncountry to formulate regulatory requirements on the safe use of ionizing radiation and regulate its uses \\nthrough licensing of facilities for the different applications of ionizing radiation including medical uses.  \\nIn 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a white paper  on an initiative to reduce \\nunnecessary radiation exposure from high radiation dose modalities like CT, fluoroscopy, and nuclear \\nmedicine examinations. This initiative was in response to the dramatic increase in the amount of \\nradiation patients are current ly being exposed to. Through this, the FDA aimed to promote the safe \\nuse of imaging modalities, the use of clinical decision support systems and guidelines and increased \\npublic awareness by defining the stakeholders responsible for safer applications.  \\nIn 2012, the IAEA and the World Health Organization (WHO) published a joint statement on the use of \\nradiation in medicine during a scientific meeting in Bonn, Germany. The list of actions that concluded \\nthis meeting represents the Bonn Call for Action, listed below:  \\nAction 1: Enhance the implementation of the principle of justification.  \\nAction 2: Enhance the implementation of the principle of optimization of protection and safety.  \\nAction 3: Strengthen the manufacturers’ role in contributing to the overall safe ty regime.  \\nAction 4: Strengthen radiation protection education and training of health professionals.  \\nAction 5: Shape and promote a strategic research agenda for radiation protection in medicine.  \\nAction 6: Increase availability of improved global informatio n on medical exposures and occupational \\nexposures in medicine.

In re sponse to the Bonn Call for Action, the European Union and the European Society of \\nRadiology established Euro safe Imaging in 2014 to strengthen the radiation safety culture in Europe. \\nEuro safe Imaging been very active in conferences and research that pro mote best practice in radiation \\nprotection. Similarly, Canada, Japan, Latin American countries, and African countries have all \\nestablished individual initiatives complimenting the Bonn Call for Action (i.e., Canada Safe, Japan safe, \\nLatin Safe, and Afro Sa fe) supported by the International Society of Radiology (ISR), IAEA and WHO to \\nfacilitate the Bonn Call for Action implementation in each region. In 2017, all chairmen of radiological \\nsocieties in the Arab World signed the establishment of Arab Safe in Mar rakesh, Morocco; a radiation \\nprotection movement in Arab countries that aims to impact the current diagnostic imaging practice, \\nsupport self -regulation, and increase awareness of radiation safety for patients.  \\nCurrently, the Saudi population is exposed to unknown amounts of ionizing radiation from medical \\napplications. Over the years, the practice of using radiation in medicine (specifically in radiotherapy \\nand nuclear medicine) has been regulated by local authorities, though some of them are no longer \\nactive. However, significant variation in safety standards among diagnostic imaging service providers \\nlocally is still a discernible problem. Diagnostic radiology practices in Saudi Arabia were not efficiently \\nmonitored, licensed or regulated until 2017.  Rece ntly, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) \\nestablished a National Radiation Safety Committee, published a set of hospital safety requirements for \\nradiation use, and conducts site visits to report misuse. In 2018, the Nuclear and Radiological \\nRegulatory  Commission (NRRC) was established to regulate, monitor, and protect people and the \\nenvironment from the hazards of radiation. The NRRC published an extensive draft in 2020 that will \\nserve as the regulation guideline for use of ionizing radiation in medici ne. All these efforts aim to \\nsupport users and make sure that the benefit from using imaging modalities is achieved while keeping \\nthe risk at minimum. Previously, neither government nor private health organizations that use ionizing \\nradiation implemented a  national standard for safe use of medical radiation in practice. Therefore, \\nmuch effort is still needed to bring about a measurable impact on the current practice and to ensure \\nthe highest standards of patient safety are followed.   \\nAdditionally, non -ionizing radiation is used in some medical procedures which are associated with \\nsignificant risk to humans. These procedures include the use of ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation, \\nand laser. Effects and safe uses are contained in the International Commi ssion for Non -Ionizing \\nRadiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines. The National Council for Laser Excellence (NCLE) is the only \\ncross -industry board that provides standard and proctored examination certification of laser operators, ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 219}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 221 of 251 \\nnurses and technicians. Th e basis of formalizing a laser safety program is set forth in the American \\nNational Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136.3 standards for safe use of lasers in health facilities. Legally, \\nANSI does not have the power to enforce these standards, therefore the sta ndards remain voluntary \\nand not a requirement. Practically, ANSI standards are implemented in healthcare facilities because of \\nthe enforcement of other agencies such as the Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA). \\nOSHA Publication 8.1 -7 is an instructional handbook that lists the safety requirements based upon ANSI \\nstandards and evaluates safe laser practice. Locally, the SFDA has been regulating the applications of \\nlasers in medicine to ensure minimum accidents and harm in healthcare facilitie s. Their effort in this \\nfield is very important especially in the private sector as they are the primary users of medical laser.  In \\ncontrast, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are two areas of medical imaging that use \\nsound waves and magneti c fields, respectively. However, these modalities are both unmonitored \\npractices from the safety point of view, which also do not comply with any safety standards and lack \\nformal regulations. The American College of Radiology (ACR) came out with safe MR pr actice guidelines \\n(ACR guidance document on MR safe practices), that has become the national standard of care for MR \\nsafe practices in the USA. The risk of producing bioeffects as a result of ultrasonographic acoustic \\nenergy has been studied with the suppo rt of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and \\nBiology (WFUMB) where conclusions and recommendations have been accepted. Conversely, \\nguidelines have been published by the National ultrasound safety committees. These \\nrecommendations and guideline s facilitate a safe application of diagnostic ultrasound. In the United \\nStates, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the acoustic output from ultrasound \\nequipment.  \\nThis document, the CBAHI Radiation Safety Priority, contains standards for th e safe use of ionizing and \\nnon-ionizing radiation in medical institutions. The standards are based on the recommendations and \\nrequirements of IAEA, ICRP and ICNIRP. It contains 7 priority standards that are focused on addressing \\nthe safe use of ionizing an d non -ionizing radiation in diagnostic and therapy procedures and \\ninvestigations. It has specific safety standards for patients, occupational workers and facilities. The \\ndocument requires the participation of hospital management in radiation safety, partic ularly in giving \\nradiation safety and protection the highest priority in its management decisions. The document \\nincludes the hospital’s management role in radiation emergency response, optimization of protection \\nof patients and occupational workers and pat ient dose optimization to ensure that doses of patients \\nare as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Each standard provides the compliance requirements \\nwhich will serve as the indicator that the medical institution has met the requirements of the specific \\nstandard.

Also, this \\npriority follows NRRC and SFDA requirements and all hospitals will have to comply with both in the \\ncoming years. Compliance with CBAHI Radiation Safety Priority should not pose any additional budget \\nburden to the hospital.  \\nThe objective of this document is to evaluate the capability and assess the readiness of medical \\ninstitutions to implement radiation safety requirements and to promote patient safety by  enforcing \\nstandards of radiation protection as required locally and internationally.  \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 220}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 222 of 251 \\n \\nRS.1.

HAIs are one of \\nthe most alarming public health problems worldwide with serious adverse effects. Moreover, they are \\nassociated with increased morbidi ty and mortality rates and prolonged hospital length of stay, leading \\nto an increase in healthcare costs, which will increase the burden on patients, healthcare workers, and \\nthe healthcare system.  \\nSome HAIs are related to the use of invasive devices such a s a central line that could lead to central \\nline-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), Foley catheters leading to catheter -associated urinary \\ntract infection (CAUTI), and ventilators leading to ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) and \\nventilator -asso ciated event (VAE). On the other hand, some HAIs are iatrogenic but non -device \\nassociated, including bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), and pneumonia; or \\nprocedure -related, including surgical site infections (SSI), and other HAIs  are associated with the \\ndialysis procedures.  \\nThe increasing antimicrobial resistance poses a challenge to surveillance systems and raises concerns \\nabout multidrug -resistant organisms' impact on patient safety  . By controlling HAIs, infection or \\ncolonizatio n by multidrug resistance microorganisms could be decreased. Regular and vigilant \\nsurveillance of HAIs, with timely reports to stakeholders, is an essential component of patient safety \\nand healthcare improvement initiatives. Furthermore, surveillance will provide baseline data for \\nassessing the progress of preventive measures.  \\nThe reported case -fatality rate of HAIs ranges from 2.3% to 14.4%, depending on the infection type.  \\nHospitals need to develop a monitoring system for HAIs to collect data using stand ardized  collecting \\nmethods and unified definitions based on the most used commonly used references worldwide (CDC's, \\nNational Healthcare Safety Network NHSN). The aim is to estimate unit -specific HAIs rates and device \\nutilization ratios with benchmarking o f results against recognized regional and international rates \\nincluding those published by the National Health Safety Network (NHSN), the International Nosocomial \\nInfection Control Consortium (INICC) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  \\nRisk Reduction Strategy:  \\n1.

Care Bundles:  \\nCare “bundles” in infection prevention and safety are simple sets of evidence -based practices \\nthat, when implemented collectively, improve the reliability of their delivery and improve \\npatient outcomes. Several specific bundles are available that can be implemented at hospitals \\nin resource -limited settings. These packages of care contribu te to infection prevention, reduce \\nunnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and may limit the development of antibiotic resistance in \\nhospitals.  \\nGeneral principles:  \\na. The implementation of care bundles can assist in enhancing compliance to evidence -\\nbased quality process measures to improve patient care.  \\nb. Care bundles include a set of evidence -based measures (where possible backed by level \\n1, randomized controlled trial evidence) that when implemented together have shown \\nto produce better outcomes and have a greater  impact than that of the isolated \\nimplementation of individual measures.  \\nc. Bundles also help to create reliable and consistent care systems in hospital settings since \\nthey are simple (three to five elements), clear, and concise.  \\nd. In addition to creating safer  patient care environments, the implementation of bundles \\nalso promotes multidisciplinary collaboration since they are developed collaboratively \\nand consensus is obtained with strong clinician engagement and endorsement.  \\ne. For bundle implementation to be successful, each element of the bundle is \\nimplemented collectively with complete consistency to achieve the most favorable \\noutcomes (“all or none” approach).  \\n• The effective implementation of a care bundle requires that the measures are \\nadapted to the local setting; appropriately followed; entrenched in the patient \\ncare culture and recorded and evaluated to ensure compliance by all members \\nof the health care team involved.  ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 232}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 234 of 251 \\nf. Healthcare providers are advised to continuously follow each bundle element for every \\npatient. This aims to develop and promote a positive habit -forming behavior among \\nproviders and ultimately a reliable care process.  \\ng.

Hand Hygiene:  \\nCleaning hands with alcohol hand rub or antimicrobial soap eliminates potential pathogens \\nfrom spreading in the healthcare setting.  In 1847, Ignaz Semmelweis  demonstrated hand \\ndisinfection\\'s effectiveness in cutting nosocomial infections. Healthcare work ers\\' hands are \\nrepeatedly in contact with patients and their surroundings, making hand surfaces the most at \\nrisk for contamination with microorganisms during the delivery of care and potentially the \\nvehicles for transferring microorganisms. Hand hygiene is  a vital element of infection control, \\ncrucial to safeguard patients\\' safety in hospitals. It is the base for Infection Prevention and \\ncontrol (IPC) standard precautions. Nonetheless, compliance with appropriate hand hygiene \\npractices is often lacking. Cos t estimations of healthcare -associated infections significantly \\nexceed those related to hand hygiene. Training on hand hygiene is multimodal and focus on:  \\n1) Preventing the transmission of microorganisms  \\n2) Factors that have been found to influence hand h ygiene behavior  \\n3) Proper hand hygiene techniques.  \\n4) Training also includes recommendations about when to clean one\\'s hands, based on the \"five \\nmoments for hand hygiene\":  \\n1. Before initial contact with the patient  \\n2. Before a clean/aseptic procedure  \\n3. After body fluid exposure risk  \\n4. After touching a patient.  \\n5. Before or after initial contact with the patient environment.  \\nHand hygiene is a broad term that covers handwashing, hand antisepsis, and actions taken to \\nmaintain healthy hands and fingerna ils. One hand hygiene method is handwashing; removing \\nsoil and transient microorganisms from the hands using soap and water. An alternative hand \\nhygiene technique is hand antisepsis, which includes removing or killing resident and transient \\nmicroorganisms on the hands using an antiseptic agent by either rubbing the hands with alcohol ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 234}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 236 of 251 \\nor handwashing with an antiseptic soap. This latter process has also been referred to as \\nantiseptic hand wash, antiseptic hand -rubbing, and hand disinfection. The use of an alc ohol -\\nbased hand rub (ABHR) is the preferred method of hand hygiene in healthcare settings unless \\nexceptions apply (i.e., when hands are visibly soiled with organic material or if exposure to \\nnorovirus and potential spore -forming pathogens such as Clostridi oides difficile  is strongly \\nsuspected or proven, including outbreaks involving these organisms).  \\nHand hygiene performed with an ABHR may reduce the impact of some of the identified \\nbarriers to handwashing, including lack of time, inaccessibility of design ated handwashing sinks, \\ninadequate supplies for handwashing (e.g., hand towels, soap).  \\nHand hygiene at Point -of-care: This refers to the place where the following three factors join: \\nthe patient, the healthcare provider, and treatment/care, that mandate c ontact with the \\npatients or their surroundings. WHO recommends that this scenario \"enforces the need to \\nperform hand hygiene at recommended moments precisely when care delivery takes place”. \\nThis requires that hand hygiene products (e.g., alcohol -based han d rub, if available) be easily \\naccessible and as close as possible - within arm\\'s reach of where patient care or treatment is \\ntaking place. Point -of-care products are accessible without having to leave the patient zone.   \\nIn addition, the role that patient s\\' families and visitors play in transmitting infection is also well \\ndocumented in the literature. The hospital\\'s hand hygiene program targets patients and their \\nfamilies and visitors, including education on entry and the posting of reminders.  \\nAssessing c ompliance with hand hygiene practices allows hospitals to improve education and \\ntraining regarding hand hygiene, evaluate hand hygiene facilities and benchmark compliance \\npractices across the hospital. Studies have shown that improvements in compliance wit h hand \\nhygiene practices have decreased the number of healthcare -associated infections. The best \\nmethod for measuring compliance with accepted hand hygiene practices is to use direct \\nobservation (audits). Direct observation involves watching and recording the hand hygiene \\nbehaviors of staff and observing the work environment.  \\nCompliance to hand hygiene policies and procedures during aseptic techniques, and as part of \\nrespiratory etiquette can be assessed through education and regular supervision by the \\ninfection control team.   \\n \\n \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 235}), Document(page_content=\" \\nPage 237 of 251 \\n \\nHAI.1 .

Data on each implemented care bundle is regularly collected, analyzed and evaluated \\nat the infection prevention and control committee and all relevant departmental meetings for \\ncontinual performance improvement/action plans.  \\nExplanations:  \\nMDROs are defined as microorganisms, predominantly bacteria, that are resistant to one or more classes \\nof antimicrobial agents. Although the names of certain MDROs describe resistance to only one agent (e.g., \\nMRSA, VRE, CRE), these pathogens are frequently  resistant to most available antimicrobial agents.  \\nPrevalence of MDROs varies temporally, geographically, and by healthcare setting.  \\nThe type and level of care also influence the prevalence of MDROs. Critical care areas such as ICUs, \\nespecially those at te rtiary care facilities, may have a higher prevalence of MDRO infections than do non -\\nICU settings.  \\nOnce MDROs are introduced into a hospital, transmission and persistence of the resistant strain is \\ndetermined by the availability of vulnerable patients, sel ective pressure exerted by antimicrobial use, \\nincreased potential for transmission from larger numbers of colonized or infected patients (“colonization \\npressure”) and the impact of implementation and adherence to prevention efforts.  \\nThe hospital administra tion of ensures that appropriate strategies are fully implemented, regularly \\nevaluated for effectiveness, and adjusted such that there is a consistent decrease in the incidence of \\ntargeted MDROs.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files/CBAHI 4TH EDITION National Healthcare Priorities.pdf', 'page': 243}), Document(page_content=' \\nPage 245 of 251 \\n \\nFire Safety  (FS) \\n \\n \\nFS.1.
